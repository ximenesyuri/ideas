# About

This repository is designed to present and discuss project ideas at any stage of development, potentially attracting collaborators. The focus is on software development projects, encompassing both practical and theoretical levels.

# Usage

Create an issue with a clear and concise title, and use labels to classify it according to the main technology stack, scope, and development stage. Include a detailed description of your idea, and feel free to tag potential collaborators or add any additional information you consider relevant.

The emphasis is on Open Source projects.
